    "**Starting point for Week 4 submission is: Code submission for week 3 from Abhijit Sinha**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this E-tivity is to help you become confident in calculating matrix determinants, inverse of a matrix and cross product of a vector with another vector, and in creating a Python class to represent this functionality in a reusable way. Note that the generic term for matrix and vector like structures is 'tensor'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task (Complete by Saturday Week 4)\n",
    "With the final version of the code from the peer you selected in E-tivity 3 as a starting point, create a class that contains one tensor and provides the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the size of the tensor as a 2D tuple\n",
    "* Sum/subtract the tensor with another tensor of suitable size\n",
    "* Multiply the tensor with a tensor of suitable size\n",
    "* Calculate the determinant of the tensor, but only for tensors of size 2x2 (matrix)\n",
    "* Calculate the inverse of the tensor, but only for tensors of size 2x2\n",
    "* Calculate the cross product of the tensor with another tensor of suitable size\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B.: \n",
    "* Use the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository for week 4.\n",
    "* Limit your code to use for tensors of rank 1 and 2 (vectors and matrices)\n",
    "* Write your code without the use of imported modules.\n",
    "* Provide suitable exception handling to prevent the above operations from being used on unsuitable tensors.\n",
    "* Test your code with one example for each of the following scenarios:\n",
    "*   sum of a 4x4 with a 4x4 matrix\n",
    "*   multiplication of a 4x4 with a 4x4 matrix\n",
    "*   multiplication of a 4x4 matrix with a suitable vector\n",
    "*   determinant of a 2x2 matrix\n",
    "*   inverse of a 2x2 matrix\n",
    "*   cross-product of 2 suitable tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "GIT commit your tested code and push to your remote branch. Submit a message to the E-tivity 4: Matrix Determinant, Inverse and Cross-product forum with a detailed description of how you have implemented the above described functionality and the name of your git branch. As part of your post, provide calculations for the determinant, inverse and cross product methods with the tensors you chose for your tests. You may add these calculations to your post using the formula editor or as a scan of handwritten notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Respond (Complete by Wednesday Week 5)\n",
    "GIT pull the code from your peer who has created a class based on your functions made in E-tivity 3. Respond in the E-tivity 4: Matrix Determinant, Inverse and Cross-product forum with respectful and in-depth assessment of your peer’s implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflect (Complete by Saturday Week 5)\n",
    "Use the feedback provided to you, and any other insights you have gained since writing the original code to improve the code you wrote in this E-tivity. GIT push the result to your remote branch and submit to Sulis using the link in 'Uploads and Submissions' below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the feedback and improvements I made in my final submission:\n",
    "1.  Correct the cross-product calculation to only process 3x1 matrices\n",
    "2.  Thanks to Martin Power for clarifying the 2D cross product scenario for me\n",
    "3.  Abhi and Martin found they got unresolved reference errors on the func_add function which I resolved by adding the self reference.\n",
    "4.  Abhi also suggested a rename of the maytricks() function which I replaced with references to tensor.matrix to access the matrix variable in the objbect, and with a **\\__str__** override for printing - I first saw the use of overrides in (I think) Cormac Lavery's post\n",
    "5.  Abhi pointed out I didn't reference the __description()__ function - I had thought I would need this to provide a way to convert the matrix to a string - this is now implemented using the function override\n",
    "6.  As the __shape()__ function is called more than once for some object instances, I initialized shape as a public property in the init for efficiency, and made the existing public shape function a private one (i.e. **\\__shape**) - as suggested by Abhi. I also took some inspiration from Martin Power and his implementation of \\__shape.\n",
    "7. Abhi pointed out I could change the return Null to return Null in **inverse()** - but as Fergal pointed out, the statement won't execute as I raise a Valueerror prior to that.\n",
    "8. Fergus also suggested I could replace my multiple if statements in check_tensor_dimension with a dictionary (e.g. http://www.usrsb.in/blog/blog/2011/12/29/implementing-switches-with-dictionaries/). I decided not to do this as I think the code is more readable without it.\n",
    "9. Thanks to Mark Murnane's post, I've used the convention of single underscore prefix for non-public functions.\n",
    "10. Somehow I had omitted an implementation for **matrix subtraction** from my first submission, so I added that with appropriate tests.\n",
    "11. Finally, I replaced my use of **ValueError** with **TypeError** where the error was related to invalid types in functions."
