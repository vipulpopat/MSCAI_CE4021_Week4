# Week4

Purpose

The purpose of this E-tivity is to help you become confident in calculating matrix determinants, inverse of a matrix and cross product of a vector with another vector, and in creating a Python class to represent this functionality in a reusable way. Note that the generic term for matrix and vector like structures is 'tensor'.
Task (Complete by Saturday Week 4)

With the final version of the code from the peer you selected in E-tivity 3 as a starting point, create a class that contains one tensor and provides the following methods:

    Calculate the size of the tensor as a 2D tuple
    Sum/subtract the tensor with another tensor of suitable size
    Multiply the tensor with a tensor of suitable size
    Calculate the determinant of the tensor, but only for tensors of size 2x2 (matrix)
    Calculate the inverse of the tensor, but only for tensors of size 2x2
    Calculate the cross product of the tensor with another tensor of suitable size

N.B.:

    Use the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository for week 4.
    Limit your code to use for tensors of rank 1 and 2 (vectors and matrices)
    Write your code without the use of imported modules.
    Provide suitable exception handling to prevent the above operations from being used on unsuitable tensors.
    Test your code with one example for each of the following scenarios:
        sum of a 4x4 with a 4x4 matrix
        multiplication of a 4x4 with a 4x4 matrix
        multiplication of a 4x4 matrix with a suitable vector
        determinant of a 2x2 matrix
        inverse of a 2x2 matrix
        cross-product of 2 suitable tensors

GIT commit your tested code and push to your remote branch. Submit a message to the E-tivity 4: Matrix Determinant, Inverse and Cross-product forum with a detailed description of how you have implemented the above described functionality and the name of your git branch. As part of your post, provide calculations for the determinant, inverse and cross product methods with the tensors you chose for your tests. You may add these calculations to your post using the formula editor or as a scan of handwritten notes.
