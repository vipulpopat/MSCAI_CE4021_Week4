    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with the Problem Description, I created a Tensor class and used Andrew's functions as the core methods for the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Andrew's implementation was function based, I added class variables to hold the dimensions of the Tensor, as well as it's elements.  To facilitate class creation, I added an `__init__` method that takes either a list or tuple representation of the tensor, validates it and stores it internally.  As my own E-tivity 3 implementation ([here](https://gitlab.com/CE4021/Group2/week3/blob/MarkMurnane/Etivity3.ipynb)) used a class, I copied this method over.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifications to Andrew's code\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the class structure as a pseudo-module for tensor calculations on other structures, I decided to implement the Tensor class as an operable unit, i.e. that it is the subject of operations.   To use Andrew's functions as the methods of the class, the parameters had to be adjusted to use `self` as the first parameter.  This altered the signature of the (now) methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial release, I've tried to minimise the internal changes, by renaming method parameters and then assigning them to method-scoped names, so that the code can be re-used without modification (e.g. `common_calculation`).  Some functions changed more radically by the fact that there are now object properties.  For example, as the size/shape of the Tensor is now a property of the class, the `get_size` method was reduced to simply returning the value of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incorporating my own Etivity 3 Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate unit testing for the conversion to classes, I've taken the override operators I deinfed in my own Etivity 3 code and implemented them in this `Tensor`class.  Instead of calling out to my own code, they call out to Andrew's code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One additional change that was made here was to include my own validity checks for multiplication.  This was not present elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit tests themselves were modified to check for ValueErrors as used by Andrew.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New functionality for Etivity 4\n",
    "\n",
    "* Added a new method `det()` to calculate the determinant of the Tensor object.  Following the initial submission, method has been expanded to nxn matrices.  Specific cases are used for 1x1 and 2x2 matrices.  Larger matrices use the Laplace expansion.  This is not the most computationally efficient, but is relatively easy to follow.  The method returns a `ValueError` for non-square matrices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Added a new method `inverse()` to calculate the inverse of a Tensor object.  This is currently confined to a 2x2 matrix.  This method works on the basis of:\n",

    "Although some of my peers have implemented cross product for 2D vectors, I've elected not to do this.  Transforming to a 3D matrix with a z-component = 0 would be straightforward (and is what numpy does).  Numpy returns the determinant of the matrix formed by those vectors, or assumes that the z-component is 0.  I'm not sure of the validity of either approach.  I feel it won't always be true, but perhaps I just don't understand the maths properly.\n",
