    "With the final version of the code from the peer you selected in E-tivity 3 as a starting point, create a class that contains one tensor and provides the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the size of the tensor as a 2D tuple\n",
    "* Sum/subtract the tensor with another tensor of suitable size\n",
    "* Multiply the tensor with a tensor of suitable size\n",
    "* Calculate the determinant of the tensor, but only for tensors of size 2x2 (matrix)\n",
    "* Calculate the inverse of the tensor, but only for tensors of size 2x2\n",
    "* Calculate the cross product of the tensor with another tensor of suitable size\n",

    "**Guidelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write your code without the use of imported modules.\n",

    "* multiplication of a 4x4 with a 4x4 matrix\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with the Problem Description, I created a Tensor class and used Andrew's functions as the core methods for the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Andrew's implementation was function based, I added class variables to hold the dimensions of the Tensor, as well as it's elements.  To facilitate class creation, I added an `__init__` method that takes either a list or tuple representation of the tensor, validates it and stores it internally.  As my own E-tivity 3 implementation ([here](https://gitlab.com/CE4021/Group2/week3/blob/MarkMurnane/Etivity3.ipynb)) used a class, I copied this method over.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifications to Andrew's code\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the class structure as a pseudo-module for tensor calculations on other structures, I decided to implement the Tensor class as an operable unit, i.e. that it is the subject of operations.   To use Andrew's functions as the methods of the class, the parameters had to be adjusted to use `self` as the first parameter.  This altered the signature of the (now) methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial release, I've tried to minimise the internal changes, by renaming method parameters and then assigning them to method-scoped names, so that the code can be re-used without modification (e.g. `common_calculation`).  Some functions changed more radically by the fact that there was now object properties.  For example, the size/shape of the Tensor was now a property of the class, the `get_size` method was reduced to simply returning the value of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incorporating my own Etivity 3 Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate unit testing for the conversion to classes, I've taken the override operators I deinfed in my own Etivity 3 code and implemented them in this `Tensor`class.  Instead of calling out to my own code, they call out to Andrew's code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One additional change that was made here was to include my own validity checks for multiplication.  This was not present elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit tests themselves were modified to check for ValueErrors as used by Andrew.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New functionality for Etivity 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Added a new method to calculate the determinant of the Tensor object.  At this time, this applies to 2x2 matrices only.  The method checks for this shape and throws a `TypeError` for other size matrices.  "
